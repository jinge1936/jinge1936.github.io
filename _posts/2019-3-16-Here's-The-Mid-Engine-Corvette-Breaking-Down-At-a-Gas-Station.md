title: Here's The Mid-Engine Corvette Breaking Down At a Gas Station
abstract: We’ve heard the mid-engine C8 Chevrolet Corvette has been plagued with delays over development issues, particularly with the implementation of General Motors’ new global electrical system. We’re not sure if that’s what is to blame here, but what we do know is one of the camouflaged C8 mules had a rather embarrassing public breakdown at a gas station in the Detroit area recently.
