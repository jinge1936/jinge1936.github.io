    title: Buying a car can be stressful, especially if salespeople are trying to run a scam on you. Alan Diaz, a branch manager for Cartelligent, listed eight of the most common scams you might encounter at a car dealership. If a deal seems too good to be true, he said, it probably is. Buying a car from a car dealership can be a stressful experience. It's even worse when the dealer is trying to run a scam on you. Your best defense is to arm yourself with knowledge before you go car shopping, according to Alan Diaz, Southern California branch manager for the car-buying service Cartelligent. "If you plan things out and give yourself some time, it will pay off drastically," Diaz told Business Insider. Although the internet has leveled the playing field - "you can google info on the spot," he said, and "dealers have to be better" - you should still be on the lookout for questionable tactics and deals that seem too good to be true. Here are eight of the biggest scams Diaz said dealers try to pull when you're buying a car.
